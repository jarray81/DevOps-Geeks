 ### how to create ConfigMaps and configure Pods using data stored in ConfigMaps ?

1. Create ConfigMaps from directories

You can use kubectl create configmap to create a ConfigMap from multiple files in the same directory. When you are creating a ConfigMap based on a directory, kubectl identifies files whose basename is a valid key in the directory and packages each of those files into the new ConfigMap. Any directory entries except regular files are ignored (e.g. subdirectories, symlinks, devices, pipes, etc).

# Create the local directory
mkdir -p configure-pod-container/configmap/

# Download the sample files into `configure-pod-container/configmap/` directory
wget https://kubernetes.io/examples/configmap/game.properties -O configure-pod-container/configmap/game.properties
wget https://kubernetes.io/examples/configmap/ui.properties -O configure-pod-container/configmap/ui.properties

# Create the configmap


kubectl create configmap game-config --from-file=configure-pod-container/configmap/


# What is a Pod Security Policy?

A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls security sensitive aspects of the pod specification. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system, as well as defaults for the related fields. They allow an administrator to control the following:



# Motivation (Label and Selectors)
## Labels

Labels enable users to map their own organizational structures onto system objects in a loosely coupled fashion, without requiring clients to store these mappings.

Service deployments and batch processing pipelines are often multi-dimensional entities (e.g., multiple partitions or deployments, multiple release tracks, multiple tiers, multiple micro-services per tier). Management often requires cross-cutting operations, which breaks encapsulation of strictly hierarchical representations, especially rigid hierarchies determined by the infrastructure rather than by users.

Example labels:

"release" : "stable", "release" : "canary"
"environment" : "dev", "environment" : "qa", "environment" : "production"
"tier" : "frontend", "tier" : "backend", "tier" : "cache"
"partition" : "customerA", "partition" : "customerB"
"track" : "daily", "track" : "weekly"
These are just examples of commonly used labels; you are free to develop your own conventions. Keep in mind that label Key must be unique for a given object.

For example, hereâ€™s the configuration file for a Pod that has two labels environment: production and app: nginx


```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: label-demo
  labels:
    environment: production
    app: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.7.9
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```
